    "# Python Introduction\n",
    "***\n",
    "# What is Python?\n",
    "Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* web development (server-side),\n",
    "* software development,\n",
    "* mathematics,\n",
    "* system scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What can Python do?\n",
    "* Python can be used on a server to create web applications.\n",
    "* Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.\n",
    "* Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.\n",
    "* Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\n",
    "* Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Python?\n",
    "* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "* Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "* Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Good to know\n",
    "* The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.\n",
    "* In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Syntax compared to other programming languages\n",
    "* Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n",
    "* Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
    "* Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python Indentation\n",
    "***\n",
    "Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code\n",
    "Example\n",
    "if 5 > 2:\n",
    "  print(\"Five is greater than two!\")\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Python Comments\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "* Comments can be used to explain Python code.\n",
    "* Comments can be used to make the code more readable.\n",
    "* Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Comment\n",
    "Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "#This is a comment\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:\n",
    "Example\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\") #This is a comment\n",
    "\n",
    "A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:\n",
    "Example\n",
    "#print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "print(\"Cheers, Mate!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiline Comments\n",
    "* Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "#This is a comment\n",
    "#written in\n",
    "#more than just one line\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "* Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "This is a comment\n",
    "written in\n",
    "more than just one line\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "* As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.\n",
    "\n"

    "# Python Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "* Variables are containers for storing data value.\n",
    "* Variables in python are __created when you assign a value to them__.  The assignment operator(=) which is denoted by the equal sign(=) is used to assign a value to a variable.\n",
    "* Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Casting\n",
    "* If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.\n",
    "Example\n",
    "x = str(3)    # x will be '3'\n",
    "y = int(3)    # y will be 3\n",
    "z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get the Type\n",
    "* You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.\n",
    "Example\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = \"John\"\n",
    "print(type(x))\n",
    "print(type(y))\n",
    "\n",
    "### String Variables - Single or Double Quotes\n",
    "* String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:\n",
    "Example\n",
    "x = \"John\"\n",
    "#is the same as\n",
    "x = 'John'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case-Sensitive\n",
    "* Variable names are case-sensitive.\n",
    "Example\n",
    "This will create two variables:\n",
    "a = 4\n",
    "A = \"Sally\"\n",
    "#A will not overwrite a\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Variable Names\n",
    "***\n",
    "A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:\n",
    "* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character\n",
    "* A variable name cannot start with a number\n",
    "* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )\n",
    "* Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)\n",
    "* A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi Words Variable Names\n",
    "* Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. #### Camel Case\n",
    "Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:\n",
    "myVariableName = \"John\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. #### Pascal Case\n",
    "Each word starts with a capital letter:\n",
    "MyVariableName = \"John\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. #### Snake Case\n",
    "Each word is separated by an underscore character:\n",
    "my_variable_name = \"John\"\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Assign Multiple Values\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Many Values to Multiple Variables\n",
    "* Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:\n",
    "Example\n",
    "#Multiple values to multiple variables\n",
    "x, y, z = \"Orange\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\"\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "print(y)\n",
    "print(z)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One Value to Multiple Variables\n",
    "And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line.\n",
    "Example\n",
    "#One value to multiple variables.\n",
    "x = y = z = \"Orange\"\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "print(y)\n",
    "print(z)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unpack a Collection\n",
    "If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.\n",
    "Example\n",
    "#Unpack a list:\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "x, y, z = fruits\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "print(y)\n",
    "print(z)\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Output Variables\n",
    "***\n",
    "* The Python print() function is often used to output variables.\n",
    "Example\n",
    "x = \"Python is awesome\"\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:\n",
    "Example\n",
    "x = \"Python\"\n",
    "y = \"is\"\n",
    "z = \"awesome\"\n",
    "print(x, y, z)\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:\n",
    "Example\n",
    "x = \"Python \"\n",
    "y = \"is \"\n",
    "z = \"awesome\"\n",
    "print(x + y + z)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Notice the space character after \"Python \" and \"is \", without them the result would be \"Pythonisawesome\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:\n",
    "Example\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = 10\n",
    "print(x + y)\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error:\n",
    "Example for error\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = \"John\"\n",
    "print(x + y)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:\n",
    "Example\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = \"John\"\n",
    "print(x, y)\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Python - Global Variables\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Global Variables\n",
    "* Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "#Create a variable outside of a function, and use it inside the function\n",
    "\n",
    "x = \"awesome\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def myfunc():\n",
    "  print(\"Python is \" + x)\n",
    "\n",
    "myfunc()\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "#Create a variable inside a function, with the same name as the global variable\n",
    "\n",

    "### The global Keyword\n",
    "* Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.\n",

    "### Expression\n",
    "* The expression is the current item in the iteration, but it is also the outcome, which you can manipulate before it ends up like a list item in the new list:\n",

    "* The expression can also contain conditions, not like a filter, but as a way to manipulate the outcome:\n",
